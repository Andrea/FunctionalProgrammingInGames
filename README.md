Functional Programming In Games
============================

## Some resources for Functional Programming in Games Resources

## Books

* [Game Programming in Haskell](https://leanpub.com/gameinhaskell)
* [Friendly F#](http://www.amazon.com/Friendly-Fun-game-programming-Book-ebook/dp/B005HHYIWC) Not totally about games but all examples are game related
* [Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/)
* [Realm of Racket](http://realmofracket.com/)

### Tutorials


* [F# game tutorial series with Monogame](http://bruinbrown.wordpress.com/f-game-tutorial-series/)
* [Arcadia - Clojure on Unity3d](https://github.com/arcadia-unity/Arcadia)

### Videos

* [A reactive game stack: Using Erlang, Lua and Voltdb to enable a nonsharded game world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiBvOGP-GNg)
* [Writing a game in Haskell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MNTerD8IuI)
* [F# in Social Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMfqNfAGZHg)
* [My adventures with Elm](https://vimeo.com/113703868)

### Presentations

* [My adventure with Elm](http://www.slideshare.net/theburningmonk/my-adventure-with-elm-46396046)

### Papers

* [Monadic Scripting in F# for Computer Games](http://www.dsi.unive.it/~orsini/documenti/MonadicScripting2.pdf)
* [A Formal Specification for Casanova,a Language for Computer Games](http://www.dsi.unive.it/~orsini/documenti/SpecificationCasanova.pdf)

### Libraries and engines

#### Haskell
* [HELM](http://helm-engine.org/) An FRP game engine inspired by Elm. 
* [FunGEn](http://joyful.com/fungen/) A BSD licensed, cross platform non FRP game engine written in Haskell.* 
* [Haskell game related libraries](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/#cat:game)

#### F C&#35;

* [Duality Scripting](https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/DualityScripting) Allows you to write F# on the Duality Game Engine (the compiler is integrated into the editor so you can write code on any editor you want). This plugin supports C# too.

##Note
Actually, I'm thinking that logic programming resources could also live here, perhaps we need to rename this?
