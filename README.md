Functional Programming In Games
============================

Welcome to this page! I don't know you, but when I was learning how to do functional programming I wanted to program fun things, so I was looking for FP in games and there wasn't much around at the time... so I started a list.

**Please note: this list is not complete. If you find something missing or incorrect, please send a PR or create an issue specifying the problem.**

### Libraries and engines

#### Haskell
* [HELM](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/helm) An FRP game engine inspired by Elm. 
* [FunGEn](http://joyful.com/fungen/) A BSD licensed, cross platform non FRP game engine written in Haskell.* 
* [Haskell game related libraries](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/#cat:game)
* [LambdaHack](https://github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack) Haskell game engine library for roguelike dungeon crawlers.

#### F &#35;

* [Duality Scripting](https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/DualityScripting) Allows you to write F# on the Duality Game Engine (the compiler is integrated into the editor so you can write code on any editor you want). This plugin supports C# too.
* [Nu Game Engine](https://github.com/bryanedds/FPWorks) cross-platform F# 2D game engine. It encourages to use as the architecture a variation of FRP which he calls Iterative Functional Reactive Programming.
* Unity 3D can be used with F#. There are multiple examples in the internet, for example [this one](https://github.com/Thorium/Roll-a-ball-FSharp).

#### Clojure

* [play-clj](https://github.com/oakes/play-clj) A wrapper around [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). It supports pc, Android and iOS (through [RoboVM](http://robovm.com/)).
* [brute](https://github.com/markmandel/brute) An Entity Component System which supports both Clojure and ClojureScript. Some information on the thinking behind the implementation are on the author's [blog](http://www.compoundtheory.com/brute-entity-component-system-library-0-2-0-the-sequel/).
* [Arcadia](http://arcadia-unity.tumblr.com/) Clojure integrated into the Unity engine. It uses ClojureCLR. It has been used for interactive art installations and game jam games.

#### Scala

* [Indigo](https://indigoengine.io/): From their site: "Indigo is written in Scala (powered by Scala.js), as are the amazing games you'll make. It's intended for the people who really like pure functions, but being Scala, allows you too flip back to a more procedural or object oriented styles if that suits you or your game better."
* [SGL](https://github.com/regb/scala-game-library): Scala Game Library (SGL) is a library for developing cross-platform 2D video games in Scala. It provides a high-level API for building games, and can export games to the Desktop, Android, and the web. More platforms, including iOS and consoles, are on the roadmap.

#### Shipped or in development commercial games made with FP languages
* [Onikira: Demon Killer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/310850/Onikira__Demon_Killer/) is a 2D side scrolling beat â€˜em up set in a fantasy feudal Japan. It's on Steam (tho unsupported), parts of it written in F#.
* [Wayward Tide](http://blog.chucklefish.org/set-sail-for-wayward-tide/) A game in development, targeting pc and written in Haskell
* [Magic Cookies](http://keera.co.uk/blog/2015/03/19/magic-cookies-released-google-play/) Published on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magic-cookies/id1244709871) and [Google Play for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.keera.games.magiccookies), it's written in Haskell.
* [Nikki and the Robots](https://github.com/nikki-and-the-robots/nikki) is a 2-dimensional platform game written in Haskell, now open source. It's published on Steam.
* [Asteroid Sharpshooter] published on Xbox Live Indie Games, written in F#. [Slides on the development process](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1teGhBf-m7qRkMzsbCKvRcIEo-QLwdK9w8VOEWqu1qWQ/edit#slide=id.p). His [blog](http://sharp-gamedev.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/asteroid-sharpshooter-post-mortem.html) has more information on how he made [F# work with XNA on Xbox 360](http://sharp-gamedev.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/xna).

#### Open Source Games
* [Haskanoid](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/haskanoid) A breakout game in Haskell using SDL and FRP, with Wiimote and Kinect support. [Available on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.keera.games.breakout.beta).
