Functional Programming In Games
============================

Welcome to this page! Hope you find what you are looking for

I don't know you, but when I was learning how to do funcitonal programming I wanted to program fun things, or something other than a "website for your cat(tm)" so I was looking for FP in games and there wasn't much around at the time... so I created this list.


**Please note: this list is not complete. If you find something missing or incorrect, please send a PR or create an issue specifying the problem.**



Thanks

### Libraries and engines

#### Haskell

#### F &#35;

* [Duality Scripting](https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/DualityScripting) Allows you to write F# on the Duality Game Engine (the compiler is integrated into the editor so you can write code on any editor you want). This plugin supports C# too.
* [Nu Game Engine](https://github.com/bryanedds/FPWorks) cross-platform F# 2D game engine. It encourages to use as the architecture a variation of FRP which he calls Iterative Functional Reactive Programming.
* Unity 3D can be used with F#. There are multiple examples in the internet, for example [this one](https://github.com/Thorium/Roll-a-ball-FSharp).
* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) can be scripted with F#. Setup guides for [Godot 3](https://hamy.xyz/labs/2022-11-godot-script-with-fsharp) and [Godot 4](https://hamy.xyz/labs/2023-04-godot-4-script-fsharp).

#### Clojure

* [play-clj](https://github.com/oakes/play-clj) A wrapper around [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). It supports pc, Android and iOS (through [RoboVM](http://robovm.com/)).
* [brute](https://github.com/markmandel/brute) An Entity Component System which supports both Clojure and ClojureScript. Some information on the thinking behind the implementation are on the author's [blog](http://www.compoundtheory.com/brute-entity-component-system-library-0-2-0-the-sequel/).
* [Arcadia](http://arcadia-unity.tumblr.com/) Clojure integrated into the Unity engine. It uses ClojureCLR. It has been used for interactive art installations and game jam games.

#### Scala

* [Indigo](https://indigoengine.io/): A Scala 3 / Scala.js 2D game engine built specifically for functional programmers.
* [SGL](https://github.com/regb/scala-game-library): Scala Game Library (SGL) is a library for developing cross-platform 2D video games in Scala. It provides a high-level API for building games, and can export games to the Desktop, Android, and the web. More platforms, including iOS and consoles, are on the roadmap.
